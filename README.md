The product details shows the list of technologies, business Models, and also trl and Costs. All the fields are populated by api data. Once the user clicks the edit button, the edit state of the component will be activated and the contentEditable fields (all the list elements) become editable. Users can edit, delete and also add list items. 

The trl has select options in which the options are populated by the `baseApi/trls/` request. There is a dropdown to select from the trls. When the user clicks the save button the updated fields of the product details will be assigned as payload for the put api request. 

### Rich text editor
The rich text editor allows users to write text, format it and save it. Bold, italics, indent, unindent, ordered list, unordered list, left, center, right, justify, hyperlink, undo, redo are the formatting functionalities. 

In addition there is a wordCount which counts in real time and the editor will not let  users write once the max word limit is reached. Also the word count text turns to red. 

The editor descroption and title are populated from data fetched from backend api. Once the user completes the writing and clicks the save button a put request will be sent to the backend api to save the changes to database. 

Built with React Quill library.
