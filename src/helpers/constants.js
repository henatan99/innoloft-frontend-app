    "description": `In structural Mechanics, the Finite Element method is used 
      to simulate structural deformations and laods, e.g. for the design of components 
      in mechanical or civil engineering. The more complex the stuructural deformations
      are, the longer simulation times associated with convergence problems can last.
      This is where the present invention comes in, by combining the classical Finite
      Element Method with artificial intelligence. This is the first method in the 
      literature that significantly improves simulation times and convergence properties
      in this way.
